This is solution for python API challenge.

Clone repo into a local directory.
Create file api_keys.py inside directory WeatherPy and supply keys
- weather_api_key="XXX" from https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys
- geoapify_key="YYY" from https://api.geoapify.com/

The contents of file api_keys.py should look like
weather_api_key="code here"
geoapify_key="another code here"


- Open WeatherPy/WeatherPy.ipynb and run;
- Next, open WeatherPy/VacationPy.ipynb and run;

Please note, WeatherPy.ipynb must be run beforehand because VacationPy uses tables preared by the WeatherPy.
